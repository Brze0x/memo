# Memo App
Hi! This app is good for memorizing lines, poems, speeches, and other text-based materials.
At the moment it's simple python script with a SQLite database.

The implementation itself is based on a system of cards where on the other side you have a question, and on the other side you have an answer to it. I also tried to implement the Leitner System in it.

Also I am planning to add an interface based on PySide
